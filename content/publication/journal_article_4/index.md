abstract: One defining characteristic of China's policy innovation is the use of"experimentation points". However,due to the lack of adequate data and analysis tools,the existing literature has not yet provided a full picture of China's policy experimentation points. We coded all the People's Daily's reports on policy experimentation points from 1992 to 2003 to study patterns that may appear. Variables included the time, policy areas, initiators and locations of experimentation points.Based on our findings,the pattern of policy experimentation points has been significantly influenced by China's top- down political authority. Specifically,policy preferences of the central government affect the likelihood of a policy area to be chosen to conduct experiments. Furthermore, superior governments are more likely to initiate policy experimentation points and have the ability to install experimentation points in policy areas when necessary.

summary: The government system of China has been well known for its ability to mobilize its local leaders through career incentives. Does this system also encourage local policy innovation? This paper tests the relation between career advancement and local policy innovation with a self-compiled dataset on local innovation and local leaders’ career paths in 16 deputy-provincial level municipalities. We find a strong positive relationship between reported local policy innovation concerning economic issues and local leaders’ career advancement from 1980 to 2008, while the relationship between the number of innovations in other policy areas and promotion is insignificant. This finding deepens our understanding of both the promotion system for Chinese local leaders and motivations for local policy innovation.
