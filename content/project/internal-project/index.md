  My dissertation develops and empirically tests a novel theory of bureaucratic appointment using originally collected data of China’s provincial agency leaders. Specifically, my dissertation attempts to answer the following puzzles: Why are most provincial agency leaders appointed from outside of an agency? Why do some appointees have no relevant work or education experience at all? Why has the trend of appointing outsiders increased over time from the early 1980s? My theory proposes that two factors – the degree of interactions politicians have with local bureaucrats and the level of monitoring from above – jointly affect politicians’ strategies in appointing agency leaders.
