<h2> Welcome! </h2>

I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the City University of New York – Baruch College. During 2022-2023, I am also a Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia-Harvard China and the World Program. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland.

I study political economy and bureaucratic politics, with a regional specialization in China. Part of my research focuses on the political control of bureaucrats and the quality of government. My dissertation, also my book project, studies the politics of appointing insiders and outsiders in China’s provincial government agencies. Part of my research focuses on Chinese overseas investment, especially on how Chinese investment affects local public opinion.
