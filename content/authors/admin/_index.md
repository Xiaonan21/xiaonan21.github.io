<h2> Welcome! </h2>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland. I study political economy and bureaucratic politics, with a regional focus on China. My research on political economy includes both domestic politics and international political economy of China. I am also interested in causal inference with observational data. 

My dissertation studies the politics of appointing insiders and outsiders, using an originally complied dataset of China’s provincial agency leaders from 1978 to 2020. My research on international political economy of China focuses on China’s outward FDI.
