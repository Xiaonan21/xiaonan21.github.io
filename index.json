Yet, the promise of new jobs and other benefits may outstrip the supply, leaving many disappointed. We present a theory of unmet expectations and political blame, which we test by connecting 223 georeferenced Chinese FDI projects to the political-economic perceptions of 179,278 respondents in Africa. We show that the announcement of Chinese FDI projects inspires economic optimism and bolsters perceptions of political leaders’ competence for about one year. Once projects are operational, however, individuals living near those projects view the economy as worse than it would have been in the absence of FDI, and perceptions of political leaders similarly decline. This pattern of unmet expectations and political blame does not appear in the context of Chinese foreign aid.","tags":null,"title":"FDI, Unmet Expectations, and the Prospects of Political Leaders: Evidence from Chinese Investment in Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John McCauley","Margaret Pearson","Xiaonan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636848000,"objectID":"788a83992deeabe6ee878bfe2fca6167","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/journal-article-7/","publishdate":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-7/","section":"publication","summary":"Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Africa is quickly becoming a centerpiece of China’s approach to promoting development overseas. To this point, however, little is known about the extent to which those investment projects inspire popular support for a China model of development in Africa, or whether Chinese FDI invites skepticism and concern among community members in the region. In this study, we investigate the effects of proximity to Chinese FDI on local perceptions of China’s approach to development in Africa. We geolocate 200 Chinese investment projects, and we spatially connect those data to responses from over 35,000 georeferenced survey respondents across 21 countries. By comparing responses from those living near operational Chinese FDI projects to responses from those living near eventual locations of Chinese investment but where no project yet exists at the time of the survey, we determine the proximity effects of Chinese FDI on views of the China model of development while accounting for the potential nonrandom location of those investment projects. The findings indicate that, on average, living near Chinese FDI projects reduces support for a China model of development. Furthermore, specific types of FDI projects evoke distinct evaluations of China’s presence. Specifically, respondents living near manufacturing projects view infrastructure development as a positive contribution from China, whereas those living near resource-related projects express concerns about Chinese land grabs and job threats. Those living near service projects hold more mixed views. The results suggest that people living in close proximity to Chinese FDI projects in Africa are swayed less by global development narratives than by how those projects shape their everyday lives and experiences.","tags":null,"title":"Does Chinese Investment in Africa Inspire Support for a China Model of Development?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaonan Wang","Yan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636502400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636502400,"objectID":"fb6ea52396ba7eabb6f7f106dd04bb0b","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/journal-article-6/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-6/","section":"publication","summary":"Political leaders in China regularly launch anti-corruption campaigns to win public support. But how are anti-corruption signals perceived? We use event study to examine the case of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign – an unprecedented effort in China to fight corruption. Contrary to expectations, we find that for the firms with connected officials later investigated, the initial anti-corruption signals – speeches from the top leadership and earlier crackdowns on other senior officials – did not decrease their stock prices. We argue that the perceived high costs of following through and repeated campaigns in the past paradoxically nurtured cynicism. We exploit the case of Zhou Yongkang and Ling Jihua – the two officials who were alleged to involve in the power struggle and whose downfall had circulated widely since 2012. We find that when the targets of earlier crackdowns were connected to Zhou or Ling, the stock prices of the firms went down only if their connected and later investigated officials were in the same faction; the stock prices of the other firms, however, went up. We interpret the results as investors’ misperceptions of the campaign in the beginning. Our findings suggest that even real efforts in campaign-style enforcement can be dismissed.","tags":null,"title":"Too Cynical: Why Stock Market in China Dismissed Anti-corruption Signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My book-length dissertation addresses the following puzzles about China’s bureaucratic appointments: Why are most provincial agency leaders appointed from outside of an agency instead of from inside?

When provincial leaders cannot find trusted agency insiders (due to information problems of adverse selection and moral hazard) or when the threats of being held accountable become more credible (due to increased monitoring), they appoint agency outsiders to shield themselves from potential trouble.

I argue that when politicians lack sufficient and credible information on the character of bureaucrats, increased monitoring forces politicians to prioritize minimizing risks over bureaucratic expertise. Using an original dataset of 1465 China’s provincial agency leaders, I find that after an unexpected anticorruption campaign, the proportion of agency leaders with inside-agency work experience drops significantly in agencies with higher risk of corruption, but not in agencies with lower risk of corruption. I interpret the results as provincial leaders’ cautiousness to reduce the higher risk of corruption associated with agency insiders, thus avoid being implicated by their appointees’ mistakes. I further demonstrate that appointing outsiders was not driven by seeking candidates with better abilities or higher political standards — two intended objectives of tightening up bureaucratic appointments. My findings qualify the effectiveness of relying on top-down accountability to regulate bureaucratic appointments in authoritarian regimes.","tags":null,"title":"Play It Safe and Appoint Outsiders: The Unintended Consequence of Anti-corruption Campaigns on Bureaucratic Appointment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaonan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"c1a343d632506cd2bd0a28c2874ed17e","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/working-paper-4/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/working-paper-4/","section":"publication","summary":"Why do politicians sometimes appoint bureaucratic leaders from outside of an agency instead of from inside, even in positions where agency-specific expertise is expected to be important? I argue that politicians do not want to be tainted by their appointees’ misbehavior, and when they lack information on local bureaucrats, they appoint agency outsiders to minimize the risk of corruption between agency insiders and business clients. Using an original data of China’s provincial agency leaders, I find that provincial party secretaries are less likely to appoint agency leaders from inside when their in-province time is within 12 to 18 months, but only in agencies with high risk of corruption. Their cautiousness attenuates as their in-province time increases. I further show that this pattern is not driven by other political considerations.

A growing body of literature has focused on various strategies NGOs proactively adopt to circumvent formal restrictions and manage the risk of participation. However, a comparative case study from a four-month fieldwork in this paper reveals a previously neglected aspect of state-NGO interaction, i.e., how do NGOs perceive and process the information they get? We find that endorsement outside of the formal institution—a retired official in our case—is not perceived as credible because the retired official does not have to bear the consequence of miscalculation. On the contrary, endorsement from local supervision institution is perceived as credible. Paradoxically, the credibility comes from the institutional design that originally intends to make restriction and monitoring effective. Our study suggests that while NGOs have various ways to seek endorsement, not all of them are perceived as credible. State, as the creator of uncertainty in the first place, is also the ultimate solution for it.","tags":null,"title":"Seeking Credibility from Uncertainty: How Formal Cooptation Institution Unleashes Outspoken NGOs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ciqi Mei","Xiaonan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577145600,"objectID":"966884cc0d8ac9e31fab966c4534e973","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/journal-article/","publishdate":"2019-12-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/","section":"publication","summary":"Policy scientists have long examined how policy innovation has emerged and diffused by focusing on the interaction between agents and policy programs. In contrast, this article focuses on how uncertainty in policy environments has affected the fate of policy innovation in an authoritarian state. Using original data from China’s official newspaper, the People’s Daily,it is found that the central government’s decision to promote sensitive policy experiments is a function of the perceived risks in the policy environment. The U-shaped relationship between the promotion of sensitive policy innovation and inflation reflects the wire-walking behavior of China’s central government. The central authority in China tends to promote fewer sensitive political experiments when inflation increases and resumes promoting experiments when the inflation rate passes a certain tipping point. It is also found that the central authority intentionally regulates the promotion of political experiments during important political events.","tags":null,"title":"Wire-Walking: Risk Management and Policy Experiments in China from a Comparative Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ciqi Mei","Xiaonan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"a915638b546d0360fe767a669892ae4b","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/journal_article_3/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_article_3/","section":"publication","summary":"The government system of China has been well known for its ability to mobilize its local leaders through career incentives.
