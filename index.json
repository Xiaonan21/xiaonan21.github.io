Yet, the promise of new jobs and other benefits may outstrip the supply, leaving many disappointed. We present a theory of unmet expectations and political blame, which we test by connecting 223 georeferenced Chinese FDI projects to the political-economic perceptions of 179,278 respondents in Africa. We show that the announcement of Chinese FDI projects inspires economic optimism and bolsters perceptions of political leaders’ competence for about one year. Once projects are operational, however, individuals living near those projects view the economy as worse than it would have been in the absence of FDI, and perceptions of political leaders similarly decline. This pattern of unmet expectations and political blame does not appear in the context of Chinese foreign aid.","tags":null,"title":"FDI, Unmet Expectations, and the Prospects of Political Leaders: Evidence from Chinese Investment in Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John McCauley","Margaret Pearson","Xiaonan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663113600,"objectID":"788a83992deeabe6ee878bfe2fca6167","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/journal-article-7/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-7/","section":"publication","summary":"Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Africa is quickly becoming a centerpiece of China’s approach to promoting development overseas. To this point, however, little is known about the extent to which those investment projects inspire popular support for a China model of development in Africa, or whether Chinese FDI invites skepticism and concern among community members in the region. In this study, we investigate the effects of proximity to Chinese FDI on local perceptions of China’s approach to development in Africa. We geolocate 200 Chinese investment projects, and we spatially connect those data to responses from over 35,000 georeferenced survey respondents across 21 countries. By comparing responses from those living near operational Chinese FDI projects to responses from those living near eventual locations of Chinese investment but where no project yet exists at the time of the survey, we determine the proximity effects of Chinese FDI on views of the China model of development while accounting for the potential nonrandom location of those investment projects. The findings indicate that, on average, living near Chinese FDI projects reduces support for a China model of development. Furthermore, specific types of FDI projects evoke distinct evaluations of China’s presence. Specifically, respondents living near manufacturing projects view infrastructure development as a positive contribution from China, whereas those living near resource-related projects express concerns about Chinese land grabs and job threats. Those living near service projects hold more mixed views. The results suggest that people living in close proximity to Chinese FDI projects in Africa are swayed less by global development narratives than by how those projects shape their everyday lives and experiences.","tags":null,"title":"Does Chinese Investment in Africa Inspire Support for a China Model of Development?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Margaret Pearson","John McCauley","Xiaonan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663027200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663027200,"objectID":"c1a343d632506cd2bd0a28c2874ed17e","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/working-paper-4/","publishdate":"2022-09-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/working-paper-4/","section":"publication","summary":"Scholars anticipate that foreign direct investment (FDI) results in greater influence abroad, but the influence that local citizens assign to foreign powers as a result of those investments remains an understudied channel of influence. This study examines how a foreign power’s FDI affects both its own resonance among local citizens and the influence those citizens assign to a competing power. Using a unique dataset of over 750 geolocated Chinese and US FDI projects in 23 countries in Africa and connecting those projects to survey responses from over 35,000 citizens, we demonstrate that citizen-assigned influence approximates a zero-sum game: in proximity to foreign investment projects, residents extend greater influence to the FDI-sending country and less to its major competitor. The results are driven largely by service sector projects, suggesting a prominent role for the visible goods, services, and opportunities that citizens notice and experience around them. Importantly, however, the influence that countries derive from their firms’ overseas investments in Africa cannot be likened to greater affinity: proximity to Chinese and US FDI projects decreases rather than increases citizens’ preferences for the respective country’s development approach, even as it increases their influence.","tags":null,"title":"Chinese Versus US Investment and Influence among Citizens in Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaonan Wang","Yan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662768000,"objectID":"fb6ea52396ba7eabb6f7f106dd04bb0b","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/journal-article-6/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-6/","section":"publication","summary":"Political leaders in China regularly launch anti-corruption campaigns to win public support. But how are anti-corruption signals perceived? We use event study to examine the case of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign – an unprecedented effort in China to fight corruption. Contrary to expectations, we find that for the firms with connected officials later investigated, the initial anti-corruption signals – speeches from the top leadership and earlier crackdowns on other senior officials – did not decrease their stock prices. We argue that the perceived high costs of following through and repeated campaigns in the past paradoxically nurtured cynicism. We exploit the case of Zhou Yongkang and Ling Jihua – the two officials who were alleged to involve in the power struggle and whose downfall had circulated widely since 2012. We find that when the targets of earlier crackdowns were connected to Zhou or Ling, the stock prices of the firms went down only if their connected and later investigated officials were in the same faction; the stock prices of the other firms, however, went up. We interpret the results as investors’ misperceptions of the campaign in the beginning. Our findings suggest that even real efforts in campaign-style enforcement can be dismissed.","tags":null,"title":"Too Cynical: Why Stock Market in China Dismissed Anti-corruption Signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaonan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"cb1251efeb1ff5991e29348277d3d8c4","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/working-paper-3/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/working-paper-3/","section":"publication","summary":"How do authoritarian anti-corruption campaigns affect the selection of bureaucrats? On the one hand, increased monitoring capacity after the campaign should ease politicians’ concerns about their appointees’ misbehavior when making appointment decisions. On the other hand, politicians could be frightened and thus make risk-averse decisions by prioritizing reducing corruption risks in appointments. Using an original dataset of China’s provincial agency leaders, I find that after Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign, provincial leaders appointed fewer agency leaders with inside-agency work experience in high-profile agencies with high corruption risks. I interpret the results as provincial leaders' cautiousness to reduce higher corruption risks of agency insiders, thus avoiding being implicated by their appointees’ misbehavior. I further demonstrate that appointing outsiders cannot be explained by patron-client relationships or seeking candidates with higher abilities and political skills. My findings reveal the nuanced effects of using authoritarian approaches to improve the quality of government.","tags":null,"title":"Play It Safe and Appoint Outsiders: Authoritarian Anti-Corruption Campaigns and Bureaucratic Appointments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My dissertation studies the politics of appointing insiders and outsiders in China’s provincial government agencies. This study is motivated by the following puzzles: why are most agency heads appointed from outside of the agency instead of from the inside, and why has the trend of appointing outsiders increased over time? This question is relevant beyond China, has important implications for the quality of government, and is related to the broad problem of bureaucratic authority and political control. I find that three existing theories of bureaucratic appointments – the incentive-assignment conflict (the Peter Principle), patron-client relationships, and human capital or political experience – cannot fully explain the patterns of appointing provincial government agency heads in China. I develop and empirically test a theoretical framework that draws insights from the literature on delegation and bureaucratic embeddedness. Provincial leaders face an information-collusion trade-off in appointing agency heads: while agency heads with prior experience inside the agency help reduce performance uncertainty, they can also use their information advantages to engage in corruption, especially the type of corruption that involves collusion with colleagues and business clients. Whether to appoint insiders or outsiders is a function of balancing the risk of performance uncertainty and collusive corruption. I argue that how provincial leaders balance the trade-off depends on two factors. First, provincial leaders’ information on and connections with the candidates of appointees help mitigate the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard. When provincial leaders lack information and connections, they prioritize reducing corruption risks over performance uncertainty by appointing more agency heads without inside-agency experience. Second, according to the delegation model, increased monitoring capacity should alleviate provincial leaders’ concerns about corruption risks at the appointment stage. However, authoritarian monitoring has distinctive features, including top-down control, uncertainty, and intra-party propaganda, that could lead provincial leaders to take more preventive measures by appointing more agency heads without inside-agency experience. Finally, I emphasize that the theoretical framework is more applicable to appointments in important agencies with high corruption risks.\nI built an original dataset of China’s provincial government agency heads appointed from 1978 to 2020. To my best knowledge, this is the first systematic dataset on China’s sub-national government agency heads. I use provincial party secretaries’ in-province time before making appointment decisions as a proxy for their information on and connections with sub-provincial bureaucrats. I leverage Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign starting from late 2012 as an example that successfully strengthened the party’s monitoring capacity with the authoritarian approach. I categorize important agencies with high corruption risks based on both existing studies and a self-constructed index. I use the agencies that are not high-profile high-risk as the “control” group. The empirical results provide supportive evidence to the theory. First, I find that when provincial party secretaries’ in-province time is short, they are more likely to appoint agency heads without prior experience inside the agency in the high-profile high-risk agencies. Second, I find that after Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign, provincial leaders appointed more agency heads without prior inside-agency experience in the high-profile high-risk agencies.\nThis study makes four contributions. First, it contributes to the literature on bureaucratic embeddedness by providing and empirically testing a theoretical framework that explains how political leaders deal with the dilemma of bureaucratic embeddedness in appointments. Second, it contributes to the literature on delegation by unpacking how the mechanisms work differently in an authoritarian regime. Third, it contributes to the literature on state capacity by showing that authoritarian regimes face inherent contradictions in building state capacity. Finally, this study contributes to the literature on bureaucratic appointments in China by providing a strategic explanation for what hinders the Chinese bureaucracy toward a Weberian direction.\n","date":1632960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632960000,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2021-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"My dissertation studies the politics of appointing insiders and outsiders in China’s provincial government agencies.

A growing body of literature has focused on various strategies NGOs proactively adopt to circumvent formal restrictions and manage the risk of participation. However, a comparative case study from a four-month fieldwork in this paper reveals a previously neglected aspect of state-NGO interaction, i.e., how do NGOs perceive and process the information they get? We find that endorsement outside of the formal institution—a retired official in our case—is not perceived as credible because the retired official does not have to bear the consequence of miscalculation. On the contrary, endorsement from local supervision institution is perceived as credible. Paradoxically, the credibility comes from the institutional design that originally intends to make restriction and monitoring effective. Our study suggests that while NGOs have various ways to seek endorsement, not all of them are perceived as credible. State, as the creator of uncertainty in the first place, is also the ultimate solution for it.","tags":null,"title":"Seeking Credibility from Uncertainty: How Formal Cooptation Institution Unleashes Outspoken NGOs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ciqi Mei","Xiaonan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577145600,"objectID":"966884cc0d8ac9e31fab966c4534e973","permalink":"https://xiaonan21.github.io/publication/journal-article/","publishdate":"2019-12-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/","section":"publication","summary":"Policy scientists have long examined how policy innovation has emerged and diffused by focusing on the interaction between agents and policy programs.

The U-shaped relationship between the promotion of sensitive policy innovation and inflation reflects the wire-walking behavior of China’s central government. The central authority in China tends to promote fewer sensitive political experiments when inflation increases and resumes promoting experiments when the inflation rate passes a certain tipping point.
